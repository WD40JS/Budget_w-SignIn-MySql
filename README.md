## How to use
Initialize npm and install, open node server and use localhost on port 8080.
When opening the app the user either signs up or logs in (if they have an account). From there they choose if the expense is persoanl (which adds), or business or investments (both of which takes away from initial budget). Then the user can see how their money is mapped out.
